# Zambia Decides 2021

ZAMBIA DECIDES 2021 is a practice project inspired by the many election result trackers from the 2020 US election. As Zambia heads to the polls this week I thought it would be good practice to build something similar. It is built in Python and JavaScript. The app displays current election results based on the 2 main candidates because that's really all we want to seeðŸ˜‚ and also shows the previous 2016 and 2011 election results based on the 2 main candidates at that time. It features  progress bars, choropleth maps, data tables, doughnut charts and is also a progressive web app so you can install it on your device.
